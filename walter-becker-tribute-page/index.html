  <h3>A timeline of Walter Becker's life:</h3>
 
  <ul id="dates">
    <li><strong>1950</strong> - Born on February 20 in Queens, New York</li>
    <li><strong>1968</strong> - Becker meets his long-time musical partner and Steely Dan co-founder, Donald Fagen, while attending Bard College</li>
    <li><strong>1970</strong> - Becker and Fagen co-write the soundtrack to <em>You've Got to Walk It Like You Talk It or You'll Lose That Beat</em>, a Richard Pryor film.</li>
    <li><strong>1971</strong> - The duo moved to California and formed Steely Dan, which was formed as a full group. Their initial lineup was completed by guitarists Denny Dias and Jeff "Skunk" Baxter, and drummer Jim Hodder. Becker started on bass but

    <li><strong>1972</strong> - Steely Dan releases its debut album <em>Can't Buy a Thrill</em> featuring hit singles "Dirty Work" and "Do It Again".
    </li>
    <li><strong>1977</strong> - Steely Dan release <em>Aja</em> to critical and commercial success. Rolling Stone listed it as one its Top 500 Greatest Albums of All-Time list and the Grammy's inducted it into the Hall of Fame in 2003. Despite this, Becker's
      life was in chaos due to drugs and personal tragedy, including his girlfriend's death from overdose and Becker getting hit by a car.</li>
    <li><strong>1981</strong> - Becker's personal exhaustion was exacerbated by commercial pressures and the complicated recording process surrounding the final album of Steely Dan's initial career, 1980's <em>Gaucho</em>, leading the duo to suspend their
      partnership.</li>
    <li><strong>2000</strong> - Steely Dan reform to tour and release several albums, alongside Becker's solo releases. Their comeback album <em>Two Against Nature</em> receives the Grammy for Album of the Year.</li>
    <li><strong>2017</strong> - Becker dies at the age of 67 due to currently undisclosed causes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h6 id="quote">"His life really meant something, not just to friends and family who knew him personally but his farthest flung fan out there has been touched by this guy's thoughts and his talent. I think that's the one thing we all hope for in this life is we leave something of a legacy, that's meaningful to someone else, when we leave here. He was a great guy, and we all miss him already."</h6>
